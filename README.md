## <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px"> Hey there! 

Iâ€™m [John Vusich](https://johnvusich.github.io/). Currently, I am a PhD candidate in Eran Andrechek's lab at Michigan State University. My research explores broad topics in cancer genomics and epigenomics, as well as normal development, using mouse models of breast cancer. I have over 5 years of computational biology experience and over 6 years of cancer biology and immunology experience. I still perform wet lab experiments from time to time. I am passionate about [open science](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-025-02635-7)! I am a Nextflow ambassador and an intern in a collaborative role with the Bioinformatics Core at MSU and the Institute for Cyber Enabled Research (ICER), which houses our HPC. I use [Nextflow](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow) and [nf-core](https://github.com/nf-core) pipelines for open and reproducible analysis of both public data and data produced in our lab. I am also a reviewer for [_Journal of Open Source Software_](https://joss.theoj.org/). You can reach me at VUSICHJO at MSU dot EDU.
